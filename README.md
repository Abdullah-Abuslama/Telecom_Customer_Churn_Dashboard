# Telecomm Customer Churn Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive dashboard project focused on analyzing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The project was created using Excel as part of my training at NTI and is based on a telecom dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecommunications industry. Understanding the factors that influence customer churn can help businesses develop strategies to improve customer retention. This project leverages data analytics to identify key trends and insights related to customer churn, such as the impact of contract type, payment methods, and tenure on customer retention.

## Key Insights

- **27% Churn Rate**: Over a quarter of customers are leaving, emphasizing the need for effective retention strategies.
- **Importance of Tenure**: Newer customers show a higher likelihood of churning, indicating a need for strong early engagement.
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, suggesting that promoting longer-term contracts could reduce turnover.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers paying via electronic checks exhibit higher churn rates, making this a potential risk factor.
- **Service Type**: Interestingly, customers with fiber optic services show higher churn rates compared to DSL users, possibly due to pricing.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Based on the insights, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Early Customer Engagement**: Implement strategies to engage customers from the start.
- **Promote Long-Term Contracts**: Encourage customers to commit to longer-term contracts.
- **Retain At-Risk Customers**: Develop targeted campaigns for customers at higher risk of churning.
- **Bundle Services**: Encourage customers to bundle services, such as multiple lines or tech support, to increase retention.
